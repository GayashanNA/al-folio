I am a computer scientist and a software engineer who works as the lead software engineer for the [BIPV Enabler](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/property-construction-and-project-management/research/research-centres-and-groups/solar-energy-application-laboratory/projects/bipv-enabler) project at RMIT University. Since 2020, I have contributed to the project's success by crafting the overall software architecture and engaging in hands-on development. One notable challenge in this project, involved developing a solar irradiation simulation for a building facade, taking into account the surrounding structures and the sun's positioning.

Prior to my current position, I held a senior lecturer role at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka, where I researched and taught about software engineering, data engineering, and distributed systems. I received my PhD from the University of Melbourne in 2021, with a focus on data stream processing applications in edge and cloud computing environments. I have also worked as a Java software engineer at WSO2, where I oversaw the log4j 2.0 upgrade of the Carbon Kernel and helped develop distributed caching using hazelcast. I have also completed an internship at KISTERS AG in Germany as a trainee software engineer where I developed a MOD4 protocol driver using C++.

Having worked in the software engineering domain for years, my expertise is in software/system design, data engineering, and distributed systems.
